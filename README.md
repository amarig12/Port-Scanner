<h1>Port Scanner</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This project involves creating a Python script that scans a target machine (computer) for open ports. Ports are numbered communication channels used by various network services. By identifying open ports, you can gain insights into the services running on the machine.

Functionality:</p>

- <b>The script will take the target's IP address as input from the user.</b>
- <b>It will iterate through a range of ports (default or user-defined) and attempt to establish connections.</b>
- <b>For each port, the script will determine if it's open or closed.</b>
- <b>The script will display the results, indicating open ports and their corresponding services (if known).</b>



<p>Benefits:</p>

- <b>Learn network fundamentals and explore network security concepts.</b>
- <b>Understand how ports function in communication.</b>
- <b>Gain basic experience with Python for network tasks (helpful for future projects).</b>
- <b>This is a basic port scanner for educational purposes.</b>
